 <p>This is me. And those are my sunglasses, Sunday Drive. <br/><br/>
 	Currently I am in Edinburgh, Scotland.  I have been a photographer for a little bit under three years, during which time I have travelled 
 	to more places than I ever thought I would. That drive and desire to travel has contributed strongly in motivating me to study abroad.
 	In photography my primary passion is landscapes. I love waking up before everyone else seeing the colors on display at a sunrise. This 
 	bleeds into cityscape and street photography as well however, and I find those types of photography just as captivating. If you feel like inquiring about pricing feel free to email me at zf66728@gmail.com.
