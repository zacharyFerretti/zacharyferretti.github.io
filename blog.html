        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to a new section of the website! The blog. Here I
        intend to write about what is happening at school or in my life right now.
        I am in the process of re-working my website actually so I don't know how
        much longer this website will be organized in this manner.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These past few weeks out in Scotland have been quite amazing.The work has
        not been too bad. The challenge is learning to balance the
        travel I am doing over here and the work I have. But being in this environment
        has also given me a much clearer insight into what works for me in terms of being
        productive, and I have begun to work in places, which work for me. I don't like
        working in the library (right now I am writing this from the Campus' empty
        lunchroom).<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far in the past two months, I have visited (disregarding
        Scotland and Iceland's layover) four new countries. I visited Ireland and saw
        the Cliffs of Moher. Went to Denmark to explore copenhagen and climb church spires,
        took a day trip to Sweden, and another to England. The England trip was completely on accident,
        but that story is best left for another time.<br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The month of March will be fairly busy for me, and I do not
        plan on really travelling all that much until the very end of March, as I will
        have a few final assignmetns due at the end of the March which are pivotal to my
        Grade out here. I hope to go to Switzerland and Italy then, but we will
        see what I end up being able to get accomplished. On that note, I think I
        am going to head home and begin to make dinner (over a crossword puzzle).
        Thanks for reading!
